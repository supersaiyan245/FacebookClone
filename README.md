## Overview

_**Facebook Clone** I am making a clone of the popular social media site known as Facebook. My clone will only have minimal features that are active on Facebook's Home Page.


<br>

## MVP

> My MVP will have a functional Facebook page with where anyone can post and comment with making an account

<br>

### Goals

- Create Front-End
- Make the Back-End
- Test the Back-End
- Connect the Back-End to the Front End
- Deploy App
- Add PMVP

<br>

### Libraries and Dependencies

> Use this section to list all supporting libraries and dependencies, and their role in the project. Below is an example - this needs to be replaced!

|     Library      | Description                                |
| :--------------: | :----------------------------------------- |
|      React       | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
|   React Router   | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
| Material UI      | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
|  Ruby on Rails   | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. Include a link to your component tree

[Component Tree Sample](https://gist.git.generalassemb.ly/davidtwhitlatch/414107e2560ae0bb65e233570f2fe056#file-component-tree-png)

#### Component Architecture

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Create Post form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
